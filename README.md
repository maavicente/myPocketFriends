myPocketFriends

Introduction
This current project is our answer to the challenge that was given to us in our first hackathon.
Our challenge theme was a song by 2Pac  - “Changes”. We idealized an online application for kids to use it as its own diary. This would work kind as “My dear diary” but with a twist:  the diary would actually answer their questions like an imaginary friend.

In order to reach young humans with the most incredible super powers but often silenced by some society diseases like lack of time, stress, or depression we developed an app to give them the voice they need, to make them feel safe and confident. The app presents them with some avatars with different personalities. They can choose one to write to. And they will obtain a response from that friend. That friend will be a psychologist that will be answering from simple questions to more complex ones. Psychologists can also write their notes in order to follow the situation of that kid.
In a technical aspect there will be two different APIs, one for the kids and other one for psychologists sharing the same software architecture.

You can compile our app using the build.xml file provided with the source code
